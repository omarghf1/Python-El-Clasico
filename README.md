# Python-El Clasico - Text Adventure Game

Inspired by the clash of Spanish football giants, Barcelona F.C. vs. Real Madrid C.F., this game allows you to live the dream of participating in a match as a player yourself. The setting of the match is the 2019-2020 season for the Spanish League. In the game you can expect:

- Input your player name
- To be announced in the starting lineup of your favorite team
- Make decisions that affect the result of the game

The Python code used for this game covers:

- User inputs
- User Defined Functions
- Nested Conditionals

I challenge you to play the game a couple of times and try to find the easter egg.

Good luck!
